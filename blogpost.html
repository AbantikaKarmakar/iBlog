        In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules
        to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or
        gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
        communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage
        medium. An early example is an invention of language, which enabled a
        person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or
        felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the
        distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when
        the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken
        language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across
        space and time. The process of encoding converts information from a
        source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the
        reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the
        recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for
        coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain
        language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example,
        semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the
        arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically
        individual letters, and numbers. Another person standing a great
        distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.

        In this section, we consider codes that encode each source (clear text)
        character by a code word from some dictionary, and concatenation of such
        code words give us an encoded string. Variable-length codes are
        especially useful when clear text characters have different
        probabilities; see also entropy encoding. A prefix code is a code with
        the "prefix property": there is no valid code word in the system that is
        a prefix (start) of any other valid code word in the set. Huffman coding
        is the most known algorithm for deriving prefix codes. Prefix codes are
        widely referred to as "Huffman codes" even when the code was not
        produced by a Huffman algorithm. Other examples of prefix codes are
        country calling codes, the country and publisher parts of ISBNs, and the
        Secondary Synchronization Codes used in the UMTS WCDMA 3G Wireless
        Standard. Kraft's inequality characterizes the sets of codeword lengths
        that are possible in a prefix code. Virtually any uniquely decodable
        one-to-many code, not necessarily a prefix one, must satisfy Kraft's
        inequality.

        Character encodings are representations of textual data. A given character encoding may be associated with a specific character set (the collection of characters which it can represent), though some character sets have multiple character encodings and vice versa. Character encodings may be broadly grouped according to the number of bytes required to represent a single character: there are single-byte encodings, multibyte (also called wide) encodings, and variable-width (also called variable-length) encodings. The earliest character encodings were single-byte, the best-known example of which is ASCII. ASCII remains in use today, for example in HTTP headers. However, single-byte encodings cannot model character sets with more than 256 characters. Scripts that require large character sets such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean must be represented with multibyte encodings. Early multibyte encodings were fixed-length, meaning that although each character was represented by more than one byte, all characters used the same number of bytes ("word length"), making them suitable for decoding with a lookup table. The final group, variable-width encodings, is a subset of multibyte encodings. These use more complex encoding and decoding logic to efficiently represent large character sets while keeping the representations of more commonly used characters shorter or maintaining backward compatibility properties. This group includes UTF-8, an encoding of the Unicode character set; UTF-8 is the most common encoding of text media on the Internet.
